        <h1 class="text-4xl text-red-800 font-comfortaa">Guidelines for Reviewing Courses</h1>
        <p class="text-lg font-comfortaa">
            for each course, you will be able to give a review that contains four scores and a detailed review in text.
            Please keep the following guidelines in mind when writing a review.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-comfortaa text-red-800 underline"> The Four Scores</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Personality</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">This relates to the teacher's style. There are no objectively "desirable" traits (a funny teacher is not necessarily
            better than a serious teacher, if, for instance, their chemistry jokes don't help students learn the material). It's up to you to decide whether this teacher's
            personality/style/vibe makes the course better.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Fairness</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">Pretty straightforward. Treating all students equally is fairness. Giving a reasonable amount of homework is fairness. Marking assignments
        rationally is fairness. Giving heads-ups before tests is fairness. Taking constructive criticism is fairness.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Content Coverage</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">This is about how well the course covers the content of the curriculum. Maybe the teacher has the most amazing personality,
            but at the end of the day they need to teach all the content of the course. For example, AP Biology at school should prepare its students for the AP exam in May. If it fails to do
            so, then it will recieve a low "Content Coverage" score.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Difficulty</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">Simply how challenging you find the course. This is not used to calculate the average rating of courses, because harder doesn't mean better or worse.
        </p>


        <h2 class="text-2xl font-comfortaa text-red-800 underline"> Important Rules</h2>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Be nice be respectful</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">This should go without saying. Insults, hate speech, excessive profanity, NSFW topics have no place here. Depending on severity, a user can be warned or banned.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">No personal information</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">DO NOT reveal anyone's personal information. Violation of this rule will lead to a ban. Examples of personal info include: names, birthdays, addresses, etc.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">Be truthful</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800">This is not the place to vent about a bad mark you got. Be honest, be fair. Do not accuse anyone of serious misconduct here, go to the police or a trusted adult instead.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-ooga text-red-800">There's a report button!</h3>
        <p class="text-md font-slim text-red-800"> Yep. Report bad stuff, and remeber: you only have one student email! If you do something stupid and get banned, you'll never be able to use this site again...
